\section{Discussion of Results}
\label{discres}
There are several potential reasons for the underwhelming results for the Parallel-J solutions given in Section \ref{res}. 
Probably the most significant reason for these results is that the body of code being parallelized (see Appendix \ref{apjverb}) 
potentially creates a large number of permanent and temporary objects, 
meaning that there are multiple requests for memory from the Java run-time heap. 
For example, since this work was originally intended to be a parallel implementation of J, 
several wrapper classes for were created to hold the same kind of information the current version of J\cite{ioj} 
maintains about arrays and the primitive values, like reference counts and bit flags for type information, 
and so where in a normal Scala library there would have been operations on primitive values, 
in Parallel-J these operations were encumbered by having to work on instances of wrapper classes. 
The constant creation of new objects for every single integer likely lengthened program run-time significantly.

Also, operations that took existing collections and turned them into collections of higher rank 
were implemented by copying whole collections, operating on them, 
then concatenating each sub-result to return the final result. 
This constant copying of sub-arrays could have been avoided through the use of \textit{index transformation} 
which have been described in Section \ref{repa}, potentially improving performance significantly 
by removing these unnecessary operations.
 
Additionally, the large number of wrapper classes for primitive values 
increased each Parallel-J solution's memory requirements such that even comparatively modest problem sizes
would not fit in cache, degrading performance significantly. 
This was first discovered when analyzing the performance results in Section \ref{respi}, 
in which increasing the problem size by a factor of 10, from $10,000$ to $100,000$, 
caused the program's run time to increase by a factor of 100. 
The solutions in C with OpenMP, in contrast, did not display this behavior, 
and instead only began showing significant improvements from parallelism in the same problem 
at a problem sizes of $1,000,000$.

Finally, this research did not make use of the macros introduced by Scala 2.10\cite{scala210} 
because Scala 2.10 was released too late in the research's development to be incorporated.
These macros have the potential to improve performance 
by replacing at compile time source code expressions that appear to be acting on objects 
with lower-level expressions acting on primitives, thus avoiding new object creation.

\section{Future Research}
\subsection{Parallel Implementation of J}
This research would be useful for future work towards a parallel alternative of J.
Regardless of the language chosen for implementing a parallel J, 
researchers must still consider which language features to include first in their prototype (Section \ref{desp})
and must still understand the inherently data parallel nature of the rank operator (Section \ref{fridp})
Also, the forces that lead to the choice of Scala as the language 
for this research (also listed in Section \ref{desp}), 
should suggest to future researchers the kinds of language features desirable 
for implementing a parallel J. 
If future work is done in this area in Scala 
or another language with suitable programming paradigms and libraries 
for developing a parallel implementation of J, 
then this research should be used as a prototype 
to help guide development.

Alternatively, a future parallel implementation of J
could be done in the C programming language, based on the current implementation of J\cite{ioj}. 
In order to begin this approach, 
it is strongly recommended that researchers first 
familiarize themselves with Roger Hui's documentation, ``An Implementation of J.''
Both this documentation and the full source code (under open sources licenses)
are available freely on the J Programming web site\cite{jweb}.
In addition, it seems that there are at least two viable options in such an approach 
which are possibly not mutually exclusive.
One option is to use a shared memory parallel environment such
OpenMP to parallelize operations within a single instance of a
parallel J. 
Another is to take advantage of the fact that the
current implementation of J already includes functionality to allow
for multiple instances of J to be running in the same process without
race conditions and approach future work using a distributed memory
parallel environment, such as MPI\cite{mpi}.

\subsection{Sequential and Parallel Scala Libraries for Regular Arrays using Function Rank}
Another possible extension to the work presented here 
is the development of a Scala library for arbitrary dimensional collections that uses function rank. 
This library would ideally support parallelism in much the same way 
Scala's current collections library does\cite{pc},
through conversions between sequential and parallel implementations of each collection type. 
However, it should be clear that even 
a purely sequential version of such a library would be useful 
for solving problems which requires operations on several different dimensions, 
or which are naturally expressed in a higher dimension than the original problem description.

At the time this research was conducted, 
the author was not aware of current work being done in 
generic and polytipic programming in Scala by Miles Sabin. 
In particular this work, which is collectively called ``Shapeless''\cite{shapeless}, 
supports collections whose sizes are known statically. 
This functionality would be useful for future work in developing 
a library of collections whose dimensions are known statically, 
possibly granting some or all of the advantages give when discussing 
the Haskell library \textit{Repa} in Section \ref{repa}\cite{dph}.
Combining these advantages with functions supporting function rank into a single Scala library
would lead to significant expressiveness and reduced boiler-plate code, 
and could lend itself to a future parallel implementation for good performance, as well.

\subsection{Implications for Other Work in Data Parallelism}
This research touches other fields in computing, 
such as type theory, language and library design, and parallel design patterns.
Consequently, future developments in these fields will likely impact 
future work building on this research, and vice versa. 
For example, should a functional language emerge 
with support for both numeric values in types and data parallelism, 
then formalized function rank would give programmers not only 
all the benefits of J and Parallel-J, 
but would statically catch rank and shape errors. 
Ideally, such a language provide formal function rank built-in, 
but as a standard library, thus allowing programmers 
to choose their own default function extensions (e.g. prefix and postfix agreement, see \cite{rankanduni}).

There may also be equivalent models of formalized function rank 
expressed in programming paradigms other than functional. 
For example, Parallel-J leverages Scala's object-oriented features the most to implement function rank, 
such as inheritance and encapsulation. 
Though Parallel-J extends functions to collections of higher rank at run-time, 
effecting performance and increasing the possible errors programmers must detect themselves, 
its model of formalized function rank reduces boilerplate code and 
potentially can increase performance through parallelism. 
Programmers of object oriented languages should consider these benefits 
when approaching data parallel problems.

Finally, independent of language or paradigm, 
the concept of extending functions by manipulating the rank on which they apply to their arguments 
may itself be a proper parallel design pattern, 
or at least a useful approach for problems in many design patterns.
The formalized function rank found in J and in the Parallel-J Scala library 
can help programmers exploit potential concurrency 
because it allows programmers a take existing functions and, in an inherently data parallel fashion, 
both apply them to specific ranks of a collection and 
extend them to similar problems in higher dimensions. 
Whatever the future holds in the field of parallel computing, 
this paper hopes to make researchers aware that an elegant (and race-condition safe) solution 
already exists to an entire class of data parallel problems 
and is waiting for its time to be acknowledged as, and used in conjunction with, other great ideas in the field.
